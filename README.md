# Parallel-Computing
A project that uses parallel computing in python. It attempts to beat a sequential version of itself in performing tasks rather than calculations. This program reads in an excel file, sorts it by grade, then sorts it by last name, then writes back to an excel file.

How to run:
This was run using windows therefore, you must got to your cmd as administrator and run the python file from there.
Inside each python file, you must change the filename and filename desination to where you saved the roster and blank rosters. The roster will be read while the blank roster is where everything is written to. You will need to delete all entries after each time you run the program.
Comment out the time entries to correlate to which excel file you are going with.
